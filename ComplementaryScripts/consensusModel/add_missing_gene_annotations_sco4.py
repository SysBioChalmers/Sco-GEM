# Note
The follwoing reactions has changed id in iKS1317
- DABTD -> ABTDG
- THRPD -> THRPDC


# From compare_iMK1208_content.csv comparison
We find additional reactions in Sco4 where the gene annotation is changed.
Most of the changes in gene annotation in compare_iMK1208_content.csv is that they have removed
