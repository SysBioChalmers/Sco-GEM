# ModelFiles
The ModelFiles folder is where the scoGEM model is stored in a variety of file formats in their respective sub-folder. The XML format is preferred for model exchange, simulation, curation etc., while the other formats primarily function to highlight changes in the model (YML and TXT) and to get an easy overview (XLSX).
