**Please provide relevant information below:**

### Description of the issue:
*Try to be as clear as possible: Is it something wrong/missing in the model? Is it a simulation issue? Do you have an idea of how to improve the model?*

#### Expected feature/value/output:
*If you are reporting a bug, how should the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation result look like? Cite literature if needed.*

#### Current feature/value/output:
*If you are reporting a bug, how does the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation actually look like in the `master` branch?*

#### Reproducing these results:
*If applicable, please attach any code used below (if it's matlab code replace the word "python" with "matlab".*
```python

```

#### To do:
*If specific curations are proposed, generate a list of checkboxes of steps that should be followed to solve this issue:*
- [ ] E.g. query relevant database
- [ ] E.g. generate script for performing curation

**I hereby confirm that:**
- [ ] This problem persists in the `master` branch of the repository
- [ ] A similar issue does not already exist
- [ ] I've considered asking this first in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/SysBioChalmers/sco-GEM)

*Note: replace [ ] with [X] to check the box. PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE*
