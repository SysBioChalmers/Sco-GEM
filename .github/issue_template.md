### Description of the issue:
*Try to be as clear as possible: Is it something wrong/missing in the model? Is it a simulation issue? Do you have an idea of how to improve the model? PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*

#### Expected feature/value/output:
*If you are reporting a bug, how should the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation result look like? Cite literature if needed. PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*

#### Current feature/value/output:
*If you are reporting a bug, how does the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation actually look like in the `master` branch? PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*

#### Reproducing these results:
*Please attach any code used below (if it's matlab code replace the word "python" with "matlab". PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*
```python

```

**I hereby confirm that I have:**
- [ ] Tested my code with [all requirements](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/sco-GEM#required-software---user) for running the model
- [ ] Done this analysis in the `master` branch of the repository
- [ ] Checked that a similar issue does not exist already
- [ ] If needed, asked first in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) about the issue
