### Describe the bug
Is it something wrong/missing in the model? Is it a simulation issue? *A clear and concise description of what the bug is.*

#### Expected feature/value/output:
What should the model/reaction/metabolite/simulation look like after if this bug is fixed? Cite literature if needed.

#### Current feature/value/output:
What does the model/reaction/metabolite/simulation currently look like in the `master` branch?*

#### Reproducing these results:
*If applicable, please attach any code used below (if it's matlab code replace the word "python" with "matlab".*
```python

```
## Software and OS info
* Any relevant info on python / matlab or other software versions. Is the bug reproducible with the python package versions as described in requirements.txt?*
 - OS: [e.g. iOS]
 - Matlab / Python [e.g. R2019a]
 - etc.

#### To do:
*If specific curations are proposed, generate a list of checkboxes of steps that should be followed to solve this issue:*
- [ ] E.g. query relevant database
- [ ] E.g. generate script for performing curation

**I hereby confirm that:**
- [ ] This problem persists in the `master` branch of the repository
- [ ] A similar issue does not already exist
- [ ] I've considered asking this first in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Sco-GEM/discussions)
