### Description of the feature request:
Do you have an idea of how to improve the model?
*Try to be as clear as possible: Is it something missing in the model, such as new annotations, newly annotated genes, etc. *

####  Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. 

#### Expected feature/value/output:
What should the model/reaction/metabolite/simulation look like after if this feature is implemented? Cite literature if needed.

#### Current feature/value/output:
What does the model/reaction/metabolite/simulation currently look like in the `master` branch?*

#### Reproducing these results:
*If applicable, please attach any code used below (if it's matlab code replace the word "python" with "matlab".*
```python

```
#### To do:
*If specific curations are proposed, generate a list of checkboxes of steps that should be followed to solve this issue:*
- [ ] E.g. query relevant database
- [ ] E.g. generate script for performing curation

**I hereby confirm that:**
- [ ] This problem persists in the `master` branch of the repository
- [ ] A similar issue does not already exist
- [ ] I've considered asking this first in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Sco-GEM/discussions)

*Note: replace [ ] with [X] to check the box. PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE*
